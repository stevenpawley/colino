step_select_fcbf(
  recipe,
  ...,
  threshold = 0.025,
  outcome = NA,
  cutpoint = 0.5,

}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which predictors are
affected by the step. See [selections()] for more details. For the `tidy`
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the symmetrical
uncertainty threshold used by the FCBF algorithm. Lower thresholds allow
more features to be selected.}

\item{outcome}{A character string specifying the name of the response
variable. Automatically inferred from the recipe (if possible) when not
specified by the user.}

\item{cutpoint}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the quantile at
which to split numeric features into binary nominal features. e.g. 0.5 =
median split. See details for more information on discretization}

\item{features_retained}{A tibble containing the features that were retained
by the FCBF algorithm. This parameter is only produced after the recipe has
been trained and should not be specified by the user}

\item{removals}{A tibble containing the features that were removed
by the FCBF algorithm. This parameter is only produced after the recipe has
been trained, and should not be specified by the user}

\item{role}{Not used for this step since new variables are not created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
been estimated.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}
}
\value{
An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the
 sequence of existing steps (if any). For the `tidy` method, a tibble with a
 `terms` column for which predictors were removed.
}
\description{
`step_select_fcbf` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that selects a
subset of  predictors using the FCBF algorithm. The number of features
retained depends on the `threshold` parameter: a lower threshold
selects more features.
}
\details{
This function implements the fast correlation-based filter (FCBF)
algorithm as described in Yu & Liu (2003). FCBF selects features that
have high correlation to the outcome, and low correlation to other features.

Symmetrical uncertainty (SU) is used to indicate the degree of correlation
between predictors and the outcome. A threshold value for SU must be
specified, and smaller threshold values will result in more features being
selected by the algorithm. Appropriate thresholds are data-dependent, so
different threshold values may need to be explored. It is not possible to
specify an exact number of features that should be retained

The algorithm requires categorical features, so continuous features are
discretized using a binary split (split at the median by default).
Discretization is only used within the feature selection algorithm,
selected features are then retained in their original continuous form for
further processing.

The FCBF algorithm is implemented by the Bioconductor package 'FCBF', which
can be installed with BiocManager::install("FCBF")
