\method{tidy}{step_select_forests}(x, type = "terms", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which predictors are
affected by the step. See [selections()] for more details. For the `tidy`
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{outcome}{A character string with the name of the response variable to
use to calculate the feature importance scores.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created.}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
been estimated.}

\item{engine}{A supported rand_forest engine that is supported by parsnip.
The default is "ranger".}

\item{options}{A named list of options to pass to the rand_forest engine. For
example, if `engine = 'ranger'` (the default) then options could be
`list(permutation = 'importance`) because a feature importance method needs
to be specified for this engine. This is the default.}

\item{mtry}{An integer for the number of predictors that will be randomly
sampled at each split when creating the tree models.}

\item{trees}{An integer for the number of trees contained in the ensemble.}

\item{min_n}{An integer for the minimum number of data points in a node that
are required for the node to be split further.}

\item{top_p}{An integer that will be used to select the `top_p` predictors
with the smallest p-values. A value of `NA` implies that this criterion
will be ignored.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
select the top-ranked features and those that are smaller than the cutoff
value.}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric value, in -log10(p-value) units, where predictors
with _larger_ than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies
that this criterion will be ignored.}

\item{exclude}{A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
should not be set by the user.}

\item{scores}{A tibble with 'variable' and 'scores' columns containing the
names of the variables and their feature importance scores. This parameter
is only produced after the recipe has been trained.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A `step_select_forests` object.}

\item{type}{A character with either 'terms' (the default) to return a
tibble containing the variables that have been removed by the filter step,
or 'scores' to return the scores for each variable.}
}
\value{
An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the
 sequence of existing steps (if any). For the `tidy` method, a tibble with a
 `terms` column for which predictors were removed.
}
\description{
`step_select_forests` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that selects
a subset of predictors based on the ranking of variable importance using a
`parsnip::rand_forest` supported model.
