step_select_mrmr(
  recipe,
  ...,
  outcome = NULL,
  role = NA,
  trained = FALSE,
  top_p = NA,

\method{tidy}{step_select_mrmr}(x, type = "terms", ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{recipe}{A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
operations for this recipe.}

\item{...}{One or more selector functions to choose which predictors are
affected by the step. See [selections()] for more details. For the `tidy`
method, these are not currently used.}

\item{outcome}{A character string specifying the name of response variable
used to evaluate mRMR.}

\item{role}{Not used by this step since no new variables are created}

\item{trained}{A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
been estimated.}

\item{top_p}{An integer that will be used to select the `top_p` predictors
with the smallest p-values. A value of `NA` implies that this criterion
will be ignored.}

\item{threshold}{A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
select the top-ranked features and those that are smaller than the cutoff
value.}

\item{cutoff}{A numeric value, in -log10(p-value) units, where predictors
with _larger_ than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies
that this criterion will be ignored.}

\item{threads}{An integer specifying the number of threads to use for
processing. The default = 0 uses all available threads.}

\item{exclude}{A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
should not be set by the user.}

\item{scores}{A tibble with 'variable' and 'scores' columns containing the
names of the variables and their mRMR scores. This parameter is only
produced after the recipe has been trained.}

\item{skip}{A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.}

\item{id}{A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.}

\item{x}{A `step_select_mrmr` object.}

\item{type}{A character with either 'terms' (the default) to return a
tibble containing the variables that have been removed by the filter step,
or 'scores' to return the scores for each variable.}
}
\value{
An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the
 sequence of existing steps (if any). For the `tidy` method, a tibble with a
 `terms` column for which predictors were removed.
}
\description{
`step_select_mrmr` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that will apply
minimum Redundancy Maximum Relevance Feature Selection (mRMR) to numeric
data. The top `top_p` scoring features, or features whose scores occur in the
top percentile `threshold` will be retained as new predictors.
}
\details{
The recipe will stop if all of `top_p`, `threshold` and `cutoff` are left
unspecified.
