#' Fast Correlation Based Filter for Feature Selection
#'
#' `step_select_fcbf` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that selects a
#' subset of  predictors using the FCBF algorithm. The number of features
#' retained depends on the `threshold` parameter: a lower threshold
#' selects more features.
#'
#' @inheritParams step_select_aov
#' @inherit step_select_aov return
#' @param threshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the symmetrical
#'   uncertainty threshold used by the FCBF algorithm. Lower thresholds allow
#'   more features to be selected.
#' @param outcome A character string specifying the name of the response
#'   variable. Automatically inferred from the recipe (if possible) when not
#'   specified by the user.
#' @param cutpoint A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the quantile at
#'   which to split numeric features into binary nominal features. e.g. 0.5 =
#'   median split. See details for more information on discretization
#' @param features_retained A tibble containing the features that were retained
#'   by the FCBF algorithm. This parameter is only produced after the recipe has
#'   been trained and should not be specified by the user
#' @param removals A tibble containing the features that were removed
#'   by the FCBF algorithm. This parameter is only produced after the recipe has
#'   been trained, and should not be specified by the user
#' @param role Not used for this step since new variables are not created.
#'
#' @details
#' This function implements the fast correlation-based filter (FCBF)
#' algorithm as described in Yu & Liu (2003). FCBF selects features that
#' have high correlation to the outcome, and low correlation to other features.
#'
#' Symmetrical uncertainty (SU) is used to indicate the degree of correlation
#' between predictors and the outcome. A threshold value for SU must be
#' specified, and smaller threshold values will result in more features being
#' selected by the algorithm. Appropriate thresholds are data-dependent, so
#' different threshold values may need to be explored. It is not possible to
#' specify an exact number of features that should be retained
#'
#' The algorithm requires categorical features, so continuous features are
#' discretized using a binary split (split at the median by default).
#' Discretization is only used within the feature selection algorithm,
#' selected features are then retained in their original continuous form for
#' further processing.
#'
#' The FCBF algorithm is implemented by the Bioconductor package 'FCBF', which
#' can be installed with BiocManager::install("FCBF")
