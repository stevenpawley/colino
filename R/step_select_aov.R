#' Filter Categorical Predictors using the ANOVA F-Test
#'
#' `step_select_aov` creates a *specification* of a recipe step that will filter
#' predictors using their relationship with a numerical outcome as measured
#' using an ANOVA F-test.
#'
#' @param recipe A recipe object. The step will be added to the sequence of
#'   operations for this recipe.
#' @param ... One or more selector functions to choose which predictors are
#'  affected by the step. See [selections()] for more details. For the `tidy`
#'  method, these are not currently used.
#' @param outcome A single character string that specifies a single numeric
#'  variable.
#' @param role For model terms created by this step, what analysis role should
#'  they be assigned? By default, the function assumes that resulting distances
#'  will be used as predictors in a model.
#' @param cutoff A numeric value, in -log10(p-value) units, where predictors
#'   with _larger_ than the cutoff will be retained. A value of `NA` implies
#'   that this criterion will be ignored.
#' @param top_p An integer that will be used to select the `top_p` predictors
#'   with the smallest p-values. A value of `NA` implies that this criterion
#'   will be ignored.
#' @param threshold A numeric value between 0 and 1 representing the percentile
#'   of best scoring features to select. For example `threshold = 0.9` will
#'   retain only predictors with scores in the top 90th percentile and a smaller
#'   threshold will select more features. Note that `top_p` and `threshold` are
#'   mutually exclusive but either can be used in conjunction with `cutoff` to
#'   select the top-ranked features and those that are smaller than the cutoff
#'   value.
#' @param exclude A character vector of predictor names that will be removed
#'  from the data. This will be set when `prep()` is used on the recipe and
#'  should not be set by the user.
#' @param trained A logical to indicate if the quantities for preprocessing have
#'   been estimated.
#' @param skip A logical. Should the step be skipped when the recipe is baked by
#'   bake.recipe()? While all operations are baked when prep.recipe() is run,
#'   some operations may not be able to be conducted on new data (e.g.
#'   processing the outcome variable(s)). Care should be taken when using skip =
#'   TRUE as it may affect the computations for subsequent operations.
#' @param id 	A character string that is unique to this step to identify it.
#' @return An updated version of `recipe` with the new step added to the
#'  sequence of existing steps (if any). For the `tidy` method, a tibble with a
#'  `terms` column for which predictors were removed.
#'
#' @concept preprocessing
#' @concept supervised_filter
#' @export
#' @details
#' The recipe will stop if both `top_p`, `threshold` or `cutoff` are left
#' unspecified. If both are used, they are combined via 'or'.
